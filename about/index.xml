      <description>Stephan Schroeder: 3rd Dan Aikikai   started with Aikido in 2003 while still at university and never stopped.  After finishing the university, he moved to Berlin where he continued his training in a dojo that was affiliated with Watanabe Nobuyuki, 8 Dan, (†2018) whose seminars Stephan visited for many years. The thing with Watanabe Sensei was that you probably didn&#39;t end up with concrete answers but with very interesting questions.</description>

      <description>7th Dan Aikikai, 4th Dan Iaido
Stefan Stenudd is an artist in many ways, a natural leader and gets easily bored. Yet after more that 40 years of Aikido he has yet to become bored by his own Aikido. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to assume that one got an idea of what Stefan&amp;rsquo;s Aikido looks like, but prolonged exposure will reveal its wide range and depth. This might partly be explained by a concious effort to avoid one of the trappings of being a teacher: to only teach that which you consider yourself to be &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; in.</description>

      <description>Aikido is a relatively new martial art developed in Japan by Morihei Ueshiba over the course of his life. It&#39;s three kanji/letters can be translated as &#34;the way of the harmonizing force&#34;. While basically all traditional martial arts have of moral dimension - including the imperative to not do harm (if possible) - this is at the front and center of Aikido. It is therefore more defensive in nature than other martial arts.</description>
