      <description>Stephan Schroeder: 3rd Dan Aikikai 
started with Aikido in 2003 while still at university and never stopped.
After finishing the university, he moved to Berlin where he continued his training in a dojo that was affiliated with Watanabe Nobuyuki, 8 Dan, (†2018) who&amp;rsquo;s seminars Stephan visited for many years. The thing with Watanabe Sensei was that you probably didn&amp;rsquo;t end up concrete answers but with very interesting questions.
Around 2010 Stephan started visiting the seminars of Stefan Stenudd, by now 7 Dan, who Stephan got interested in after seeing one of his YouTube videos.</description>

      <description>Stefan Stenudd: 7th Dan Aikikai, 4th Dan Iaido 
Stefan Stenudd is an artist in many ways, a natuaral leader and gets easily bored. Yet after more that 40 years of Aikido he has yet to become bored by his own Aikido. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to assume that one got an idea of what Stefan&amp;rsquo;s Aikido looks like, but prolonged exposure will reveal its wide range and depth. This might partly be explained by a concious effort to avoid one of the trappings of being a teacher: to only teach that which you consider yourself to be &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; in.</description>
